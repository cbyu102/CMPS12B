IntegerLinkedList.h was copied from the website. It is the header file and
it basically contains all the prototypes of all public operations and
statements.

IntegerLinkedList.c was also copied from the website. It is the implementation
file and it is much like the header except there are both public and private
functions. It is also more fleshed out and has the actual fuction.

Dictionary.h and Dictionary.c is pretty much the same as IntegerLinkedList.h
and IntegerLinkedList.c

DicationaryClient.c contains the main method that is used to run the program.
It uses Dictionary.h and Dictionary.c's struct. It reads in a input file
and then is able to read it so that it makes a linked list of numbers
and is able to print, add, delete and find numbers in the list. Then it prints
out what happened into the output file.
