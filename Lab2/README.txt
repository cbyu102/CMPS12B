The FileCopy.java code was given from the Lab 2 instructions. The program takes two files
and copys the contents of the first into the second one.

The FileTokens.java code was also given from the Lab 2 instructions. The program takes
the first file and finds all the tokens in the file. It then counts the number of tokens
and prints that as well as the separated tokens into the second file.

The FileReverse.java code was modified from the FileTokens.java code from the instuctions.
It basically takes the first file, "in", and finds and separates all the tokens. Then, there
is a method that reverses the token which is used before each token is printed onto the
file "out". So in the end, the file "out" will contain all the tokens of the file "in" 
in reverse.
