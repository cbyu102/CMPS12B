a set of numbers separated by commas and then prints the same set of

the in file and copies and prints each word of it on separate lines in 
the out file.

FileReverse.c is an edited version of the FileIO.c given from the lab. It
takes 2 files (in, out) and reads the in file. Then it takes all the words

own line and are printed out backwards.
